        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business ManagementðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jessica La and I am currently a first year Pre-Business student studying at the University of California, Riverside. I am still uncertain about what I want to pursue a future career in, but I know that the business world definitely has a place for me. I have some interests in fashion and merchandise, designing homes such as being an interior designer, film or movies, writing, modeling, or opening up a business of my own one day. Hopefully I can create a life for myself that could be at least one of these career goals that I am looking forward to pursuing or even possibly a mix of them one day. I would rather be pursuing a career that makes me happy and fascinated by the work I am doing rather than be obsessed with producing large amounts of money in income. Growing up, my parents owned Chinese fast food restaurants and they used to bring my sisters and I along with them so we would not be bored at home alone. We even learned how to use the cash register, occasionally serve the customers, and on some rare occasions help prepare the food that was being served. Spending a lot of time around my parents' restaurant during my childhood is what inspires me to possibly want to start up my own business one day. Even though they were constantly tired, stressed, and moved around different locations for the restaurants, I am still fascinated by the idea that I would be able to control what happens to the business and deal with its best interests. While studying at the University of California, Riverside, I am hoping to be able to further develop my social and public speaking skills as well as build myself professionally. <br><br>

        In the past, I have held leadership roles, participated in many different activities in high school, worked as a server at two different restaurants and locations, as well as took care of my grandparents and little brother. A few leadership roles that I have held were while I was in the Associated Student Body of my high school as well as was the captain for Track and Field and Volleyball. Being a part of the Associated Student Body, I had to learn how to work with large groups of people in order to achieve something amazing. Many of us had scheduling conflicts, but we knew what we were signing up for and had to learn how to set aside time to meet and make plans for school events. I had to execute several pep rallies and school events in order to promote school spirit as well as increase their involvement and attendance. I had to communicate with several other members in order to ensure all our events ran smoothly and to plan. I had to learn that criticism was not always a bad thing. Everytime we had a performance or event, there would always be that one person who said they did not like it for whatever reason. Those people are the ones who made us learn to fix and see what we could do differently.  I took some of these skills that I had learned with me into becoming the captain of track and volleyball. I had to ensure all my teammates arrived on time and that if someone could not make it, I worked as a liaison between my coaches and teammates. I learned that it is more likely that people will not follow you unless you lead by example. Working as a server, I learned how to memorize things quickly and I got those jobs to make money to bring with me to college. Taking care of my grandparents and little brother taught me that sometimes itâ€™s not a job but a responsibility to be taking care of your loved ones. All of these experiences allowed me to gain and develop better communication skills, care-taking skills, multitasking skills. These interactions are what helped me to become the person that I am today.<br><br>

        This summer, I am hoping to find a summer internship for my second year. I know that the earlier you start looking, the better it looks for future employers. I am hoping that something back in Rosemead, CA where I am from will be hiring new intern positions.
